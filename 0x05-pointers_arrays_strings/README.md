1. file 1-swap.c is a function that swaps the values of two integers, with the prototype: void swap_int(int *a, int *b);
2. file 2-strlen.c a function that returns the length of a string, with prototype: int _strlen(char *s);
3. file 3-puts.c a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. with the prototype: void _puts(char *str);
4. file 4-print_rev.c is a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line, with the prototype: void print_rev(char *s);
